# Lesson 1 A puma at large
Pumas are large,cat-like animals which are found in America.When
reports came into Lenovo Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted
forty-five  miles south of London,they were not taken seriously.
However,as the evidence began to accumulate,experts from the
Zoo felt obiliged to investigate,for the descriptions given by 
people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily
similar.
	The hunt for the puma began in a small billage where a woman
picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from he.It immediately ran away when she saw
it,and expert confirmed that a puma will not attack a huma being unless it is cornered.The search proved
difficult,for the puma was often observed at one place in the moring and at another place twenty miles
away in the evening.Wherever it went,it left behind a trail of dead deer and small animal like rabbits.
Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes.Several people
complained of 'cat-like noises'at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree.The
experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma,but where had it come from ? As no pumas
had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a
private collector and somehow managed to escape.The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was
not caught.It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside. 

#Lesson 2
Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he
has never managed to get enough money to have the church clock
repaired.The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night
was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.
	One night, however, our vicar woke up with a start: the clock
was striking the hours!Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one
o'clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped.Armed
with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on.In the torchlight, he caught sight
of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins,our local grocer.
	'Whatever are you doing up here Bill?"asked the vicar in surprise.
	'I'm tring to repair the bell,'answered Bill.'I've been coming up here night after for weeks now.
you see, I was hoping to give you a surprise."
